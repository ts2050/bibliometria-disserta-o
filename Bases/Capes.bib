abstract = {Agile practices become increasingly popular for projects and project portfolios offering firms a higher flexibility to adapt to dynamic environments. This study investigates the antecedents and consequences of agile practices' relevance for strategy formulation in project portfolio management processes. Building on complex adaptive systems theory, we hypothesize a positive relationship between agile capabilities and emerging strategy initiatives and eventually portfolio success. Agile capabilities refer to both the project portfolio organization's intensity of and competence in applying agile practices. Using a sample of 135 portfolios and multiple informants for each portfolio, the results support entrepreneurial orientation and voice behavior as antecedents for agile capabilities. Furthermore, the findings support an agile portfolio's positive relationship with emergence recognition and overall portfolio success. The findings contribute to the literature by identifying two significant antecedents of agile capabilities as well as empirically demonstrating the positive relationship between agile portfolios and emerging strategy recognition. For practitioners, the study encourages the application of agile practices by stressing the general positive influence of agile capabilities and underlines entrepreneurial orientation and voice behavior as important methods of empowerment for agile portfolio processes.
•Agile capabilities’ relevance for project portfolio management increases.•We quantitatively investigate the antecedents and consequences of agile capabilities in project portfolios.•Organizations with agile capabilities better recognize emerging strategies.•Voice behavior and entrepreneurial orientation enhance agile capabilities.},

abstract = {Organizations are currently using the potential of IT to achieve their strategic objectives. IT governance ensures that decisions related to information technologies are aligned with business needs and strategies. One of the best practices to introduce a culture of IT governance is the implementation of the IT project portfolio. However, there is a lack of studies that support this claim. We developed a rubric to evaluate the portfolio of IT projects of a university to determine its strategic nature and its alignment with the principles of IT governance. After a phase of qualitative research, we designed a survey to collect quantitative data in a real scenario. We contrasted these data with the estimated scenario through the results obtained in the previous phase. The objective of this research is to validate and improve the starting proposal as a result of qualitative research. This survey has been answered by Spanish public universities that have implemented a portfolio of IT projects and whose IT managers are aware of the ISO/IEC 38500 standard and its principles. The results have allowed us to design a rubric that can be used by universities to evaluate the relationship between the elements and the advantages of the IT project portfolio and its alignment with IT governance.},

Transmitting complete information about these projects to society is a key element of transparency, as they operate within an atmosphere of public trust. Although there is a large body of literature on transparency in NGOs from a global perspective, very little research has been conducted on transparency within the area of projects and activities. This study takes a deeper look at this line and contributes to the literature on transparency in NGOs by proposing an index to measure the information transparency of the projects implemented by these organizations. The index captures three dimensions of the information about the projects (technical, financial, and scope) and makes it possible to: analyze the level of transparency of the portfolio of projects, detect the specific aspects that could be improved in each organization, and carry out comparisons among organizations.},

However, existing methods usually only assess overall project portfolio risk and do not account for the criticality of single projects and their dependencies. Applying Bayesian network modeling to ITPPs, we bridge this gap and extend the current body of knowledge for the information systems and project management literatures. Our new method analyzes single projects' criticality in a portfolio context by considering both transitive dependencies and different dependency types in an integrated way. Since we demonstrate that single projects' criticality can vary substantially, being aware of which projects are critical is a key success factor for ITPP management. For practitioners, our method provides a straightforward procedure to enhance ITPP risk management.

abstract = {Purpose
Project portfolio management (PPM) is a managerial technique used to seek the strategic goals of organizations improving their performance. The public sector has some characteristics that differ from the private sector, since their management approaches are different. The purpose of this paper is to compare the PPM’s practices and techniques in the public and private sectors.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper uses the study case methodology through eight case studies that were undertaken in Brazil: four in public and four in private sectors. The field research used semi-structured interviews that were analyzed using the NVivo software.
Findings
In both sectors, strategic alignment is the goal of PPM, and the same tools are employed. The public sector displays better process documentation and lower risk awareness than the private sector, showing an improvement point for the public sector. The selection and prioritization criteria differ from each sector, showing the difference in the strategic goals of public and private sectors.
Research limitations/implications
The limitations of this paper are related to the number of organizations studied; however, the case studies represent organizations from different sectors and industries maximizing heterogeneity, but focusing on Brazil.
Social implications
The prioritization and effective allocation of projects spending in the Brazilian public sector could be improved with the comparison of their current practices with the ones used in private sector, increasing its transparency and cost allocation.
Originality/value
This study broadens the understanding of PPM in the public sector, which is a gap in the academic literature, comparing its practices with those used in the private sector.},

However, no valid model is available for PPB prediction. To narrow this research gap, we develop a model based on a backpropagation neural network improved with a genetic algorithm (GA-BPNN) to quantitatively forecast PPBs. First, the evaluation criteria for benefits are determined. Second, the input and output variables of the model are determined and calculated. Third, the initial weights and thresholds of the BPNN are improved by the GA. Fourth, based on the above optimization results, the GA-BPNN model is trained and tested. Last, the numerical example is provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed model. The results indicate that the established model is feasible and effective in predicting PPBs, with an average prediction accuracy rate of 98.64 %, which is 18.24 % better than that of the base BPNN. The model proposed in this paper effectively realizes the quantitative prediction of PPBs, enriching the research on project portfolio management (PPM) and providing managers with a tool to effectively predict PPBs.

Joint R&D&I projects and programs increase performance but entail project-related risks; namely, concurrent projects may share resources, delays may be inherited by later projects, and costs may overrun. With a project portfolio, one can better plan budgets, timelines, and risks, manage the resource-sharing of parallel projects, and map content-related projects as one program. However, large (publicly funded) research programs are rarely designed and managed as portfolios. This paper discerns the structure of the European Union-funded 7th Framework Program from a project management perspective. The proposed method estimates the structure based on the content, collaboration, and duration, which enables very accurate mapping of a naturally evolved, unstructured portfolio using limited publicly available data. We tested the sensitivity of overruns/delays, relative costs, and outputs to changes in the distribution of single projects, multi-projects, and programs. The results indicate that supporting programs leads to an improvement in performance, while the duration increases only slightly. The relative costs and output can be improved by moderately increasing the proportion of multi-projects and programs without the risk of overrun or delay. Although we used data from an unstructured portfolio, we believe that the results are valid for R&D&I portfolios in general. To address research policy, we suggest that understanding framework programs as portfolios of projects and managing their structure support collaboration and increase output with only a marginal impact on the cost and duration.},

Technical professionals are a key factor for IT product development. In an IT company, it is common for an employee to hold multiple skills. Multi-skilled staff increases the difficulty of project portfolio scheduling and staff assignment. This paper helps R&D managers cope with the problem by proposing a multi-objective optimization model of project portfolio scheduling and multi-skilled staff assignment. The model considers three objectives with strong practicality, i.e., staff skill enhancement, development cycle time, and product quality, and incorporates skill cultivation through a learning curve. We then propose an improved multi-objective Pareto ant colony optimization algorithm combining genetic operators to find an approximate Pareto solution set. Personalized decision rules with strong practicability are also discussed for selecting an appropriate solution.

Project portfolio management (PPM) has been recognized as critical for the productivity of research and development (R&D) investments, but empirical research on PPM use and outcomes in non-commercial R&D environments is limited. The purpose of this paper is to investigate PPM processes and outcomes in a unique R&D context within Brazilian electric power utilities.
Design/methodology/approach
An exploratory best practice survey was used to collect data on PPM processes, methods and performance results in the power sector. Analysis of the data employs descriptive statistics and comparative analysis in the light of the literature.
Findings
The findings emphasize the importance of strategic value and the need for PPM to be customized for the specific context. The results also demonstrate the importance of adopting selection criteria and measures in accordance with the organizations strategic goals.
Practical implications
The findings may help organizations better understand how PPM can be tailored for the environment. PPM managers in utilities and other non-commercial R&D environments may find guidance in tailoring and improving their PPM approaches.
Originality/value
The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it provides empirical findings to support PPM concepts on strategic alignment and the importance of context by demonstrating how PPM works to deliver strategy in a unique environment. Second, it contributes to the management of R&D projects and portfolios in power utilities, providing an example and analysis that may offer guidance.

As DT projects are disruptive to an organisation and are significantly different from traditional information technology projects, it is important to understand the value that specific DT projects will bring to an organisation before they are implemented, so that DT project portfolios can be optimally managed.Aim This study aims to determine the key goals and benefits of DT projects, as well as the selection criteria for DT projects in South African businesses. The study also explores the most influential technologies for driving the implementation of DT projects.Setting South Africa is an emerging economy. The study was performed in the initial phases of nationwide lockdown owing to COVID-19.Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 leaders from South African businesses of varying sizes, but all in significant local markets. Content analysis using CAQDAS was used to analyse the primary data, using both inductive and deductive coding methods.Results South African businesses use a combination of financial and non-financial project selection criteria across four main goals and benefit categories: customer experience, operational efficiency, business culture, and traditional project evaluation. The fifth proposed goal (new business models) was not used to evaluate DT projects. The most influential technologies that drive the selection of DT projects were data-related, such as data storage, data processing, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making.Conclusion Companies in South Africa can use traditional project evaluation criteria together with several new criteria to determine the value of DT projects more holistically. This study also suggests several key practical takeaways for businesses that are aspiring to implement their own DT projects.},

abstract = {Selecting a project portfolio is a complex process involving many factors and considerations from the time it is proposed to the time the project portfolio is finally selected. Given that making a good selection is of crucial importance, it is essential to develop well-founded mathematical models to lead the organization to its final goal. To achieve this, such models have to reflect as closely as possible both the real situation of the organization as well as its targets and preferences.
However, since the process of selecting and implementing project portfolios occurs in real environments and not in laboratories, uncertainty and a lack of knowledge regarding some data is always an important issue due to the strong interdependence between the projects and the political, economic, social, and legal conditions in which they are carried out.
In this work, a mathematical model is proposed which extends the classical approach incorporating the inherent uncertainty to these problems. We have handled this uncertainty, vagueness and/or imprecision through the use of fuzzy parameters, which allow representation of information not fully known by the decision makers. The model combines selecting and planning project portfolios, specifies different relationships between projects (synergies, incompatibilities, time order, etc.) and other important constraints appearing in real situations. Moreover, a resolution procedure is developed which obtains, simultaneously, the optimal portfolio and the range for the confidence levels associated to it. An illustrative example and a real application are given in order to show the potentiality of the approach. The results are complemented with graphical tools, which show the usefulness of the proposed model to assist the decision makers.

For this problem, a practical solution approach based on pairwise comparisons is developed. For evaluating the projects in organizations, specifically for the IT projects, a hierarchy of many DMs make project proposals and assess proposed projects using various sets of criteria.

A problem with 22 DMs and experts in a three‐level hierarchy, 29 criteria and 15 projects is solved using the proposed HGDM approach.

abstract = {There is a growing interest in fostering breakthrough technologies that offer exceptionally high value to society. However, when starting technology projects, it is impossible to know which of them have the potential to lead to breakthroughs. Therefore, organizations have adopted funding policies in which on-going projects are subjected to interim evaluations based on which some projects may be abandoned to release resources for seizing new opportunities. In this paper, we study which funding policies are optimal when the objective is either (i) to maximize the expected value of the project portfolio, or (ii) to maximize the expected number of exceptionally excellent projects that may lead to breakthrough technologies. We show that the optimal policy for funding exceptionally excellent projects is to start a large number of projects and abandon a high proportion of them later, whereas the optimal policy for maximizing the expected value of the project portfolio is to grant long-term funding to a smaller set of projects based on initial evaluation. Furthermore, we show how the trade-off between these two objectives depends on the initial project evaluation accuracy and the rate at which this accuracy improves. Our results suggest that this trade-off is particularly significant when the initial project evaluations are very uncertain but become more accurate soon after the projects have been launched. In such a setting, policies that seek to maximize the expected portfolio value may fail to promote breakthrough technologies.
•We develop a model to form guidelines for fostering breakthrough technology projects.•The model accounts for the option to abandon projects based on interim evaluation.•A large number of projects should be launched but many of them later abandoned.•This policy differs notably from maximizing the expected project portfolio value.•We show how optimal policies depend on evaluation accuracy.},

abstract = {Abstract Project portfolio management has been studied through diverse aspects. Different approaches have been used to improve project portfolio selection, but not all of them have been actually used. This study presents an artifact to improve project portfolio selection process in universities. The artifact considers strategic alignment and focuses on achieving consensus, considering university characteristics about strategic planning and decision making environment. The artifact was developed through an incremental approach using quasi-experiments in simulated situations to check and improve the accuracy of the solutions being developed. Finally, the artifact was implemented in a real situation inside a university, involving 185 projects, 15 criteria, and 12 people from different faculties and knowledge areas. Results show that the artifact is suitable to the university environment. Beyond the artifact itself and some highlights involving its development process, the multicriteria constructivist approach, the balanced scorecard, and the scoring technique, another contribution is an adapted AHP tool created to integrate traditional AHP from Saaty (1980) and a study from Bose (2015) to reduce cognitive conflict in group decision making. Other studies, in more diverse contexts, still need to be done, but the proposal seems to be promised.},

This study aimed to propose a model for diagnostic of project portfolio management (PPM) on public research institutions and to apply it over a case study. The methodology used was literature review and a single case study applied to Embrapa Beef Cattle, a Research Center of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA). Conclusion is that the model can be used for the diagnostic of PPM on public research institutions. The importance given to strategic orientation by the studied research center became evident throughout the work. This need to integrate project portfolio with institutional strategy influences the three dimensions of the model. From the results obtained it becomes evident that putting into practice an effective strategic planning for public research institutions is paramount for project portfolio success. The tool can be enhanced through incorporation of new criteria and dimensions, serving as a starting point for further work focused on public management.},

abstract = {Managing project portfolios has been a challenge to many IT organizations due to the size and complexity of their initiatives that are often cross-functional, fast changing, and transformational in nature. A governance process on project solicitation, evaluation, and monitoring is thus essential to ensure the resulting portfolio creates tangible values, balances across priorities, and supports business objectives. An optimization model to streamline the decision processes for IT portfolios and programs is proposed. We consider project characteristics such as the extent of strategic alignment, expected benefit, development cost, and cross-project synergy to maximize the portfolio value. We also consider team proficiency and resource availability to determine a project portfolio that could be implemented within the overall development time. The multi-objective model identifies the optimal mix among project types and the solution procedure efficiently produces recommendations that are superior to those found with current empirical techniques. We also describe an evolutionary algorithm to find approximate solutions to the optimization model. Possible extensions on how the optimization procedure can go beyond projects to also streamline decisions such as the renewal or replacement of in-flight applications is discussed.},

Current theory falls short in its ability to explain how the management of project-based companies evolves because of their need to be agile and adaptable in a changing environment. The purpose of this paper is therefore to present a descriptive model that elucidates the maturation processes in a project-based organisation as well as to provide an enhanced understanding of multi-project management in practice. The maturation model illustrates the way the management of project-based organisations evolves between structuring administration and managing uncertainties, and emphasises the importance of active individual actions and situated management actions that have to be undertaken in order to coordinate, synchronise and communicate the required knowledge and skills. The outcomes primarily reveal that, although standardised project models are used and considerable resources are spent on effective project portfolio management, the way information and communication are dealt with is vitally important in the management of project-based organisations. This is particularly true of informal and non-codified communication.},

abstract = {Purpose
As public organizations strive for higher e‐government maturity, information technology (IT) Project Portfolio Management (IT PPM) has become a high priority issue. Assuming control is central in IT PPM, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how a Danish local government conducts control in IT PPM. The authors identify control problems and formulate recommendations to address these.
Design/methodology/approach
Adopting principles from Engaged Scholarship, the authors have conducted a case study using a wide variety of data collection methods, including 29 interviews, one workshop, and analyses of documents.
Findings
It is found that the local government relies vastly on informal control mechanisms and five control problems are identified: weak accountability processes between the political and administrative level; weak accountability between the director level and the IT executives; IT projects established on the basis of incomplete information about internal resources; lack of operational goals to hold IT projects accountable; and no account of actual IT project costs. The authors propose a model for highlighting how more formal control can be implemented and address the identified control problems.
Research limitations/implications
As a single qualitative case study, the results are limited to one organization and subject.
Practical implications
The paper has implications for IT PPM in Danish local governments and similar organizations in other countries. The paper shows that the lack of formal control mechanisms makes accountability between hierarchical levels difficult, which deprives organizations of the opportunity to pursue and display unambiguous value from their e‐government initiatives.
Originality/value
This paper fulfills an identified need to understand how local governments can improve IT PPM.},

While allocating funds among sectors or scientific disciplines, the Decision Maker (DM) wants to maximize the total impact by supporting R&D activities in those sectors with higher scientific, social and economic return. On the other hand, the DM wants to balance the funding budget over sectors or disciplines. In this study, we incorporate the results of “sectoral impact assessments” into the public R&D project portfolio selection (RDPPS) problem. We develop a two-stage model. In the first stage, we make sectoral budget allocation decisions to maximize the total impact of the budget while ensuring a relative balance among sectors. In the second stage, we maximize the total score of supported projects under allocated sectoral budgets. We illustrate the proposed approach on an example problem. We show the value of the proposed approach by comparing our results with alternative policy options.

ITPPM allows organizations to improve the alignment of IT projects with organizational strategy, by balancing the risks and returns from inter-related projects. To contribute to our understanding of ITPPM, this study examines the adoption of ITPPM through the theoretical lens of diffusion of innovation. Using the technology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework, we model ITPPM adoption and test our model using survey data from 302 project managers. Our results show that an organization's external pressure, ITPPM costs, organizational support, quality of data on existing IT projects, number of IT projects within the organization, and business resistance are significantly related to the adoption decision. We also find interesting results in how expected benefits of ITPPM and compatibility are perceived as equally important by both adopters and nonadopters. In light of the increasingly complex IT project management environment faced by organizations, our paper helps managers to understand and focus on key enablers of ITPPM adoption and better manage ITPPM inhibitors.},

abstract = {Purpose
This research proposes a framework by which universities can define and implement projects that transform them into entrepreneurial universities. The framework helps decision-makers identify suitable goals and strategies, gather a list of projects to fulfill the goals and strategies and prioritize the projects and form a portfolio.
Design/methodology/approach
In the proposed framework, importance–performance matrix, hierarchical strategic planning, Delphi technique, DEMATEL-based ANP and a multi-objective model are used. The mathematical model consists of four objective functions including efficiency, quality and balance maximization and also cost and risk minimization. The proposed framework is applied to Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, and the results are brought in this paper.
Findings
The output of the proposed framework is a portfolio of projects that aims to transform a traditional university into a third-generation one. Although the final portfolio must be customized for different universities, the proposed steps of the framework can be helpful for almost all cases.
Originality/value
The suggested framework is unique and uses both qualitative and quantitative techniques for project portfolio selection.},

The decisions taken today relating to urban renewal interventions are rarely supported by logical and operational methodologies capable of effectively rationalising selection processes. For this purpose, it is necessary to propose and implement analysis models with the aim of promoting the sustainable development of the territory. The purpose of this paper is to define a model for the optimal allocation of scarce resources.
Design/methodology/approach
The Discrete Linear Programming (DLP) is used for selecting investments aimed at achieving financial, social, cultural and environmental sustainability.
Findings
The proposed model lends itself to the construction of investment plans on behalf of both types of decision makers, of both a public and a private nature.
Research limitations/implications
All projects are evaluated according to multi-criteria logics, so that it is possible to find compromise solutions, in accordance with the stakeholders’ different preferences.
Practical implications
The model, written with A Mathematical Programming Language using DLP logics, is tested – case study – so as to define an investment programme finalised for urban renewal of a vast area.
Social implications
The proposed econometric model makes it possible to obtain the optimal combination of projects for urban renewal with a view to achieving the sustainable development of the territory.
Originality/value
Using the proposed model, all projects are evaluated according to multi-criteria logics, so that it is possible to find compromise solutions, in accordance with the stakeholders’ different preferences.},
