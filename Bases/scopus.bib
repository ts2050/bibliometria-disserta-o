abstract={In the last decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) has affected the approach of organizations to innovation and how they create and capture value in everyday business activities. This is compounded in the so-called Smart Cities, where the objective of the IoT is to exploit information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support added-value services for citizens, giving companies more opportunities to innovate through the use of the latest technologies. In this context, multinational enterprises (MNEs) are building alliances, starting several projects with public and private city stakeholders aimed at exploring new technologies for cities but also at exploiting new IoT-based devices and services in order to profit from them. This implies that companies need to manage and integrate different types of knowledge to efficiently and effectively support the simultaneous pressure of exploration and exploitation, at a project portfolio level. Using structural equations modeling with data collected from 43 IoT smart city project alliances in Italy, this paper tests and finds evidence that MNEs need to develop knowledge management (KM) capabilities combined with ICT capabilities if they want to obtain greater ambidexterity performance at the project portfolio level. More specifically, we highlight that KM capabilities enhance alliance ambidexterity indirectly through firms’ ICT capabilities, suggesting that MNE managers should design KM tools and develop new ICT skills. Implications for academics, managers and future lines of research are proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Collaborative research projects have emerged as a particular form of academia-industry interaction. Over the past ten to fifteen years they have received increasing attention in the project portfolio of public and private organisations as well as in the project management literature. They present specific challenges, demanding of adaptations and adjustments to existing project management approaches. By means of a systematic literature review we provide a comprehensive list of the main challenges associated with these projects, as well as the guidelines, tools & techniques, and conceptual results that have been proposed to overcome them. The findings are synthesised into three main paradoxes, four general management strategies, and two main research streams. Against this background, we propose directives for future research that serve to improve the transfer of scientific knowledge into practice. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.},

funding_text 1={While research activities were traditionally mostly conducted by research institutes and universities and only results were transferred into industry, companies are now getting increasingly involved in joint research endeavours with other industry and academic partners ( Levine and Prietula, Forthcoming; Perkmann et al., 2013 ), a development that has been labelled the “6th generation of research and development management” ( Nobelius, 2004 ). Both industry and academia promote such partnerships to solve challenges that neither can tackle alone and to draw from the economic and scientific benefits ( Salter and Martin, 2001 ). A wide range of formats can be distinguished to organise joint research endeavors, ranging from single academia–industry collaborations to strategic alliances and joint ventures ( Hagedoorn et al., 2000 ), and covering inter- and intra-collaboration on various levels, such as the individual, departmental, sector, and national levels ( Katz and Martin, 1997 ). The format addressed in this paper are collaborative research projects, which are jointly financed, planned, and executed by a consortium of academic, public, and industry partners ( Davenport et al., 1998; Inganäs et al., 2009; Perkmann and Walsh, 2007 ). Partners share a common research interest and provide complementary, often inter-disciplinary resources and competencies to fulfil the project goals ( Gibbons et al., 1994; Oesterle and Otto, 2010 ). These projects play a growing role in the portfolio of public and private organisations ( Gassmann and von Zedtwitz, 2003; Nobelius, 2004 ); which has been fostered by the strong commitment of public-funding agencies to mode-2 knowledge production ( Gibbons et al., 1994 ) and multi-stakeholder models for research management ( Etzkowitz, 2003 ). Examples of large scale funding frameworks include the European Union Framework Programmes which foster multidisciplinary research and cooperative activities in Europe and beyond, 1 1 Cooperative Research Centres in Australia, 2 2 and projects funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research in Germany. 3 3 Funding opportunities are constantly increasing and so is the amount of projects to be managed. For example, the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission offers a budget of 50.5 billion euros purely in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), which is used to support 1952 projects in different stages of the project life-cycle ( European Commission, 2007 ). With the new funding scheme Horizon 2020 this investment will be further increased by 46% ( EuropeanCommission, 2013 ).},

abstract={Agile project management methods revolutionized the way how software projects are executed and organized. The question, however, on how to enable agility outside of individual projects and help larger organizations to compete with small entrepreneurial companies requires further attention. As a possible perspective, project portfolio management provides a global view on resources and their distribution across individual projects according to strategic choices. Based on 30 interviews conducted in 14 large European organizations this study contributes to the understanding of agile project management methods applied in IT project portfolios. First, we empirically identify the domains of practice. Then, guided by literature and our data we discuss the characteristics and implications of the agile portfolio management practice in our case organizations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Effective project evaluation and selection strategies can directly impact organizational productivity and profitability. Numerous analytical techniques ranging from simple weighted scoring to complex mathematical programming approaches have been proposed to solve these problems. However, traditional project selection methods too often fail to consider both the uncertainties in projects and the interaction among projects. Some prior studies have considered the interaction among projects in deterministic environments. Others have dealt with stochastic environments but have not considered project interdependencies. This study aspires to fill this gap in the project portfolio selection literature. Information system/information technology (IS/IT) projects are used in this study because they are frequently subject to uncertainties due to estimation difficulties and bounded by interactions due to technological interdependencies. We use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to select the best portfolio of IS/IT projects while taking both project uncertainties (modeled as fuzzy variables) and project interactions into consideration simultaneously. We also present a numerical example to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework and exhibit the efficacy of the procedures. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.},

abstract={Companies today need project portfolio management (PPM) to cope with the increasing number of projects and use it to ensure comprehensive management, strategic alignment, and efficient use of resources. Moreover, customers are demanding more value from their suppliers. The management of a project portfolio and the corresponding customer relationship portfolio implies a link between PPM and relationship management. By combining the fields of PPM and marketing, this study hypothesizes a connection between relationship value and project portfolio success. Because both parties need to extract value from a relationship, relationship value is divided into relationship value for the customer and relationship value from the customer. The results are based on a cross-industry sample of 174 German, Swiss, and Austrian medium-sized and large companies and rely on two informants from each firm. We find a significant relationship between relationship value and project portfolio success as well as moderating effects of portfolio interdependency, portfolio size, and technological turbulence. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.},

abstract={An optimal sustainable public transport infrastructure project portfolio selection requires an environment management strategy for both the social and economic development. This study considers the application of a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology that can be applied to assess the sustainable development of transport infrastructure projects, taking into account a range of transport, social, financial and environmental criteria. Furthermore, in order to resolve the strategic decision-making under resource constraints and the carbon footprint factor, a zero-one goal programming (ZOGP) model is developed to facilitate an optimal portfolio of sustainable public transport infrastructure projects in Taiwan. The resulting data shows that the perspective of sustainable transport and the criterion of decreasing traffic energy consumption are the most significant evaluation factors, and that the Tamhai Light Rail (TLR) Project and Tambai Expressway (TE) Project comprise by far the optimal portfolio of sustainable transport infrastructure projects which strengthen the connection between activity-based costing (ABC) evaluation and carbon footprint in a life cycle assessment. The integrated approach is a practical and useful tool for providing solution-related information for sustainable public transport infrastructure projects, and to help managers incorporate environment costs into decision-making processes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This article describes an architecture-based approach to IT valuation. This approach offers organisations an instrument to valuate their application and project portfolios and to make well-balanced decisions about IT investments. The value of a software application is assessed in terms of its contribution to a selection of business goals. Based on such assessments, the value of different applications can be compared, and requirements for innovation, development, maintenance and phasing out can be identified. IT projects are proposed to realise the requirements. The value of each project is assessed in terms of the value it adds to one or more applications. This value can be obtained by relating the 'as-is' application portfolio to the 'to-be' portfolio that is being proposed by the project portfolio. In this way, projects can be ranked according to their added value, given a certain selection of business goals. The approach uses ArchiMate to model the relationship between software applications, business processes, services and products. In addition, two language extensions are used to model the relationship of these elements to business goals and requirements and to projects and project portfolios. The approach is illustrated using the portfolio method of Bedell and has been implemented in BiZZdesign Architect. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Today's IT project portfolios (ITPP) contain many projects and varied interdependencies. Depending on a project's criticality to the ITPP, a failure can have massive consequences. However, existing methods usually only assess overall project portfolio risk and do not account for the criticality of single projects and their dependencies. Applying Bayesian network modeling to ITPPs, we bridge this gap and extend the current body of knowledge for the information systems and project management literatures. Our new method analyzes single projects' criticality in a portfolio context by considering both transitive dependencies and different dependency types in an integrated way. Since we demonstrate that single projects' criticality can vary substantially, being aware of which projects are critical is a key success factor for ITPP management. For practitioners, our method provides a straightforward procedure to enhance ITPP risk management. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Association for Project Management and the International Project Management Association},

abstract={The historical buildings can become an instrument for the growth of a territory in connection with the historic and artistic value, the ability to characterize environments and urban, rural and natural landscapes and on the basis of historical and documentary interest. This is confirmed in the numerous legislative measures that deal with urban planning at the international level. Most of the time, however, the interventions on the historical–architectural building heritage do not respond to logic capable of simultaneously ensuring the conservation and valorization. This problem is accentuated when the decision-making process is not supported by operating logical models capable of bringing into account the many effects of an investment, which are not only financial, but also social, cultural and environmental nature. The operational research, in particular discrete linear programming crossed with multicriteria analysis, can support the definition of useful models to the selection of investments on historical buildings. Intended for public authorities called to choose the projects to be financed, the model defined and tested in the present work can be easily adapted also to the case of resources allocation by private investor. The application of the model to a concrete case, concerning the definition of the projects portfolio for the valorization of buildings of historical–architectural value in a Municipality of South Italy, confirms the potential of the instrument in analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={Current developments put significant pressure on IT project portfolio management (IT PPM), increasingly requiring IT project portfolios to be strategically aligned and efficient yet agile. Accordingly, our aim is to identify IT-PPM-related tensions among the three design goals alignment, efficiency, and agility, and to elaborate a set of design principles that will provide organizations with recommendations for reconciling these goals. We conduct our research trough the theoretical lens of Activity Theory. Our findings are based on a revelatory case study in the financial services sector and are evaluated through focus group discussions and expert interviews. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA},

abstract={The primary goal in project portfolio management is to select and manage the optimal set of projects that contribute the maximum in business value. However, selecting Information Technology (IT) projects is a difficult task due to the complexities and uncertainties inherent in the strategic-operational nature of the process, and the existence of both quantitative and qualitative criteria. We propose a two-stage process to select an optimal project portfolio with the aim of maximizing project benefits and minimizing project risks. We construct a two-stage hybrid mathematical programming model by integrating Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) with Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). This hybrid framework provides the ability to consider both the quantitative and qualitative criteria while considering budget constraints and project risks. We also present a real-world case study in the cybersecurity industry to exhibit the applicability and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. © 2019},

abstract={Research and Development (R&D) is a substantial activity in the modern economy of knowledge and therefore funding R&D activities is a challenging task for private and public institutions. The difficulty in evaluation of R&D projects is mainly the inherent uncertainty that has to be dealt with. In addition, when we have funding programs, various policy constraints for the allocation of funds must be also taken into account. In this paper we propose an R&D project portfolio selection method that deals with the inherent uncertainty of R&D project evaluation. Using decision rounds with multicriteria analysis, mathematical programming and Monte Carlo simulation in the framework of the Iterative Trichotomic Approach (ITA), we manage to tackle large problems. The method is applied in a case study from Greece with 2437 project proposals from the funding action “Research-Create-Innovate” with European and National resources. Groups of experts evaluate the projects in three criteria and complex policy constraints (geographical, sectoral etc.) are also applied. The iterative nature of ITA allows for gradually converging to the final portfolio of R&D projects. The results provide information not only about the acceptance or not of an R&D project to the final portfolio, but also deal with the main source of uncertainty which is the experts’ evaluation, providing a degree of certainty for the selected and rejected projects. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper presents a methodological framework for IT project selection that focuses on the impact of synergy enhancement on portfolio return and risk. As the size of firms' IT investments continues to increase, the demand for strong methodologies for IT portfolio selection has been increasing. Using the mean-variance efficient frontier as a tool to balance portfolio return and portfolio risk, we develop a model for IT portfolio selection. Unlike existing IT portfolio selection models, in this framework, the enhanceable project interdependency, project synergy, is distinguished from the inherent project interdependency, project covariance. This model enables firms to examine the effect of synergy enhancement on project portfolio risk and highlights the benefit of portfolio management of IT projects. © 1988-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={IT project portfolio management (IT PPM) has evolved into a significant area of research interest, but we know little about IT PPM practices in public sector organizations. Therefore this article investigates decision-making processes in the IT PPM practices of local governments, and discusses how these practices match the normative advice proposed by the IT PPM literature. We rely on decision-making theories together with case-studies of four Danish local governments. We find that politics, intuition and coincidence play a crucial role in IT PPM decision-making, while technical rationality (as proposed by the IT PPM literature) plays a minor role. Our account also reveals how the decision-making practices create IT portfolio problems and in some aspects is considered to have a negative impact on the outcome of e-government investments. Our analysis and previous research into decision-making allows us to argue that implementing textbook-IT PPM is difficult because it relies on decision-making ideals that are incompatible with organizational contexts and individual behavior in these organizations. Instead of radically changing decision-making styles, the organizations might be better off improving IT PPM practice within the boundaries of their existing decision-making styles, and the IT PPM literature might improve support for practitioners by incorporating other decision-making styles besides technical rationality. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are established not with the aim of making profits but rather to provide social values by implementing different projects and activities. Transmitting complete information about these projects to society is a key element of transparency, as they operate within an atmosphere of public trust. Although there is a large body of literature on transparency in NGOs from a global perspective, very little research has been conducted on transparency within the area of projects and activities. This study takes a deeper look at this line and contributes to the literature on transparency in NGOs by proposing an index to measure the information transparency of the projects implemented by these organizations. The index captures three dimensions of the information about the projects (technical, financial, and scope) and makes it possible to: analyze the level of transparency of the portfolio of projects, detect the specific aspects that could be improved in each organization, and carry out comparisons among organizations. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Regarding to the high importance of project selection in the project life cycle, solving bid/no-bid problems, especially in the construction industry, is a subject of most recent research. Portfolio selection has been the most interesting area in the last two decades in management research but there is poor investigation in the construction industry. Taking into account the risk, which is inherent in the construction industry and especially in the project selection phase is inevitable. This paper intends to propose a model for project selection and developing two main concepts including company portfolio and risk. The main innovation of this paper is presenting a new framework, which attempts to optimize project selection based on the endurable risk level of a company with regard to the existing portfolio. Considering the user-friendly characteristic of the model, this paper has applied the fuzzy multi criteria decision-making approaches. Finally, the model is implemented in a real case study.

abstract={Agile practices become increasingly popular for projects and project portfolios offering firms a higher flexibility to adapt to dynamic environments. This study investigates the antecedents and consequences of agile practices' relevance for strategy formulation in project portfolio management processes. Building on complex adaptive systems theory, we hypothesize a positive relationship between agile capabilities and emerging strategy initiatives and eventually portfolio success. Agile capabilities refer to both the project portfolio organization's intensity of and competence in applying agile practices. Using a sample of 135 portfolios and multiple informants for each portfolio, the results support entrepreneurial orientation and voice behavior as antecedents for agile capabilities. Furthermore, the findings support an agile portfolio's positive relationship with emergence recognition and overall portfolio success. The findings contribute to the literature by identifying two significant antecedents of agile capabilities as well as empirically demonstrating the positive relationship between agile portfolios and emerging strategy recognition. For practitioners, the study encourages the application of agile practices by stressing the general positive influence of agile capabilities and underlines entrepreneurial orientation and voice behavior as important methods of empowerment for agile portfolio processes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA},

funding_text 2={Furthermore, a higher level of firm's EO likely supports individuals to live EO's characteristics in their daily work, which in turn matches the requirements of agile practices. A high level of EO is described with the focus on growth through promoting ?flexibility, creativity, continuous innovation, and renewal? (Ireland et al., 2003, p. 968). These characteristics are shared with the requirements for individuals to successfully follow agile practices, since agile practices constitute flexible and recurring approaches (Dyb? & Dings?yr, 2008). According to scrum?the most prominent agile concept?a team's workload is structured in recurring sprint cycles (Schwaber & Beedle, 2002). After each development cycle, a finished product is presented to the customer. The process itself is therefore a continuous improvement process in incremental steps (Highsmith, 2009). Thus, an entrepreneurial mindset focused on the proactive identification and venturing of potentially risky opportunities is likely to increase agile practices' acceptance and application. Furthermore, teams' autonomy and self-organization are key elements of agile practices (Sweetman & Conboy, 2018). Individuals coordinate the team's work among themselves and take responsibility for the team's performance (Highsmith, 2009). A team's management itself relies on the team members (B?cklander, 2019). Consequently, individuals, who have been socialized in a high EO organizational context, are also better in proactively managing themselves in accordance with the team.This research was financially supported by the Project Management Institute's (PMI) Sponsored Research Program (SRP).},

abstract={The article deals with some methodological aspects of evaluation of students’ educational achievements at university. Evaluation being as an essential component of the educational process includes controlling, measurement and assessment. Studying the methodological aspects of evaluation, we refer to the activity and contextual approaches. Activity approach involves using of the active forms and methods of evaluation, such as web-quests, discussions, presentations of the projects, portfolio, etc. Contextual approach allows to organize the evaluation of students’ educational achievements, providing the professional activities, which help them to master their skills. The author concludes that the use of contemporary forms of evaluation in the educational process of the university will contribute to the effectiveness of the educational process itself. © 2017 IJCRSEE.

abstract={Managing project portfolios has been a challenge to many IT organizations due to the size and complexity of their initiatives that are often cross-functional, fast changing, and transformational in nature. A governance process on project solicitation, evaluation, and monitoring is thus essential to ensure the resulting portfolio creates tangible values, balances across priorities, and supports business objectives. An optimization model to streamline the decision processes for IT portfolios and programs is proposed. We consider project characteristics such as the extent of strategic alignment, expected benefit, development cost, and cross-project synergy to maximize the portfolio value. We also consider team proficiency and resource availability to determine a project portfolio that could be implemented within the overall development time. The multi-objective model identifies the optimal mix among project types and the solution procedure efficiently produces recommendations that are superior to those found with current empirical techniques. We also describe an evolutionary algorithm to find approximate solutions to the optimization model. Possible extensions on how the optimization procedure can go beyond projects to also streamline decisions such as the renewal or replacement of in-flight applications is discussed. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to increase the current understanding of the connection between operational level information and communication technology (ICT) projects and national level digital transformation by researching how project governance structures and practices are applied in an e-government context. Design/methodology/approach: An elaborative qualitative study through public documentary analysis and empirical multi-case research on Finnish central government is used. Findings: The study constructs a multi-level governance structure with three main functions and applies this in an empirical setting. The results also describe how different governance practices and processes, focusing on project portfolio management, are applied vertically across different organizational levels to connect the ICT projects with the national digitalization strategy. Originality/value: This study integrates project governance and portfolio management knowledge into public sector digitalization, thus contributing to project management, e-government and ICT research streams by improving the current understanding on the governance of ICT projects as part of a larger-scale digitalization. This study also highlights perceived gaps between current governance practices and provides implications to managers and practitioners working in the field to address these gaps. © 2019, Teemu Mikael Lappi, Kirsi Aaltonen and Jaakko Kujala.},

abstract={Overview: While Agile development approaches to physical products have allowed companies to respond more quickly to change and increase R&D productivity, implementing these approaches also poses new challenges for new-product portfolio management. When Agile and the traditional way of measuring, evaluating, and managing projects clash, companies must reassess how portfolios are managed, how go/kill and prioritization decisions are made, and how performance is measured. This article explores the new solutions and emerging challenges at the boundary between project and portfolio management and suggests tools and approaches to deal with these new challenges. © 2020, Copyright © 2019, Innovation Research Interchange.},

abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive decision-making framework for evaluating a portfolio of IT projects. A problem of IT project selection with and without project interdependencies is considered. The problem is subject to maximum project funding budget constraint. When IT project portfolio contains independent projects, a dynamic programming (DP) solution procedure is proposed to efficiently solve the portfolio of IT projects' problem. However, when IT project portfolio contains project interdependencies, a mixed integer programming (MIP) approach is needed to solve the problem optimally. Experiments and results using simulated data using Monte Carlo simulation are provided. The results indicate that a large set of project selection problems containing up to 60 projects can be solved easily using the proposed decision-making framework. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Project Portfolio Management (PPM) is becoming a key competence for companies handling numerous projects simultaneously. PPM instructors have been largely unable to transform what is being taught into applicable skills. Gamification has been successfully applied in some educational environments and it has been increasingly applied in Management university courses. The objective of this study is to propose and assess a gamified strategy for teaching Project Portfolio Management to MBA students. The implementation of this gamified experience was carried out in 2018, 2019 and 2020 with 122 students. They were quite satisfied with the gamified experience and recognized that the Portfolio Game Experience contributed to learning different PPM techniques and processes, especially those associated with project prioritization and selection. Moreover, 100% of the respondents would recommend the course to a colleague. By qualitatively analyzing students’ feedback, this study has found out that the Portfolio Game Experience provided the students the practical experience of actively learning what they have seen in theory. Students also highlighted typical game characteristics that contribute to their learning, like the fact that the game is fun, challenging, motivating and interactive. When compared to other courses they have taken so far, students evaluate this experience as superior. © 2020},

abstract={In this paper a new approach that uses the alignment of projects with corporate strategic objectives to prioritize project portfolio in an efficient and reliable way is presented. For this purpose, corporate strategic objectives will be used as prioritization criteria to obtain the Relative Alignment Index (RAI) of each project which indicates how close or far each project is from the strategic objectives of the company. The approach presented uses the Analytic Network Process. This technique allows considering the influences among all the elements within the network, that means, the strategic objectives, and specially the projects within a portfolio. The proposed RAI index helps to select the best strategically aligned projects for the organization. The proposed RAI index and its form of evaluation have not previously been considered in the project portfolio literature until now. The research methodology for the development of RAI is based on a combination of a synthesis of the literature across the diverse fields of project management, project alignment, multicriteria decision methods and a parallel analysis of an industrial case study. The use of the proposed RAI index is demonstrated using a rigorous methodology with acceptable complexity which seeks to assist managers of the National Electricity Corporation of Venezuela, recently founded and composed by 13 merging old companies, both public and private, in their yearly resources' assignment on their projects portfolio. The aim being to determine a projects ranking based on their degree of alignment to corporate strategy and on the judgments of a group of experts, such as the management board. The new corporation assumed the challenge of setting strategic directions (Mission, Vision, Values, Strategic objectives, Plans, Programs, etc.) common to all merging companies. This approach with multi-stakeholders support allows managers to strategically allocate resources to each project in a consensual way. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We analyse all the major sources of direct and indirect research and development (R&D) support to the business enterprise sector in a single country, Norway, for the period 2002–2013, treating the financial support for R&D from several instruments as a multivariate dose exposure. The output additionality of support to incumbent firms that regularly perform R&D (R&D-incumbents), which obtain about 65 per cent of all R&D support to business enterprises, is insignificant for any instrument or policy mixture. However, the estimated additionality of support to R&D-starters (firms without prior R&D activity), which obtain about 30 per cent of all R&D support, is generally positive. In this firm category, the main instruments for direct R&D support in Norway generate significantly less output and economic activity per NOK 1 million in support than do tax credits, despite the fact these instruments manage large project portfolios at considerable administrative costs. We do not identify positive effects of R&D support on labour productivity or the return on assets for any of the instruments. Our main policy implication is that R&D instruments for the business enterprise sector should be designed in favour of R&D-starters over R&D-incumbents, that is, shifting the focus from the intensive to the extensive margin. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={This paper addresses one of the most common problems that a railway infrastructure manager has to face: to prioritise a portfolio of maintenance, renewal and improvement (MR&I) projects in a railway network. This decision-making problem is complex due to the large number of MR&I projects in the portfolio and the different criteria to take into consideration, most of which are influenced and interrelated to each other. To address this problem, the use of the analytic network process (ANP) is proposed. The method is applied to a case study in which the Local Manager of the public company, who is responsible for the MR&I of Spanish Rail Lines, has to select the MR&I projects which have to be executed first. Based on the results, it becomes evident that, for this case study, the main factor of preference for a project is the location of application rather than the type of project. The main contributions of this work are: the deep analysis done to identify and weigh the decision criteria, how to assess the alternatives and provide a rigorous and systematic decision-making process, based on an exhaustive revision of the literature and expertise. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={In traditional information technology project portfolio management (ITPPM), managers often pay more attention to the optimization of portfolio selection in the initial stage. In fact, during the portfolio implementation process, there are still issues to be optimized. Organizing cooperation will enhance the efficiency, although it brings more immediate risk due to the complex variety of links between projects. In order to balance the efficiency and risk, an optimization method is presented based on the complex network theory and entropy, which will assist portfolio managers in recognizing the structure of the portfolio and determine the cooperation range. Firstly, a complex network model for an IT project portfolio is constructed, in which the project is simulated as an artificial life agent. At the same time, the portfolio is viewed as a small scale of society. Following this, social network analysis is used to detect and divide communities in order to estimate the roles of projects between different portfolios. Based on these, the efficiency and the risk are measured using entropy and are balanced through searching for adequate hierarchy community divisions. Thus, the activities of cooperation in organizations, risk management, and so on-which are usually viewed as an important art-can be discussed and conducted based on quantity calculations. © 2017 by the authors.},

abstract={Scholars assume that the strategic direction of project portfolios is designed within organisations. Our study challenges this assumption. Taking a process perspective, we explored the long-term influence of an external partner, a university researcher, on the development of a project portfolio in a large pharmaceutical firm. By following five contracts that connected the researcher to the firm, we observed how the researcher initiated and managed projects in the portfolio, thereby keeping his influence and relevance alive. Yet, despite his long-term influence, the researcher was perceived as a ‘stranger’ with an ambiguous, and at times surprising, role. We advance our theoretical understanding of the link between portfolios and their contexts by extending the concept of project lineage to inter-organisational lineages and showing their nonlinear and social character. We also suggest related contracts, ‘contractual paths,’ as novel and useful for exploring the link between portfolios and their contexts. © 2020},

abstract={Academics have argued that data-driven decision processes will replace intuitive judgements, but the empirical aspects of this claim are understudied. We provide empirical findings of how managers communicate and share intuitive judgements when BI system's output is prescribed to be the main information source for decision making. We investigate organizational decision making regarding IT project portfolio investments. We used a rich empirical dataset from a longitudinal, qualitative study investigating the prioritization of IT projects in a large financial institution. Our findings show that decision makers employ four techniques to communicate and share intuitive judgements during organizational decision making, which built on the BI output. Furthermore, we found that the use of these techniques depends on the decision maker's familiarity with the group and the convergence of perceptions about either a project, or specific issues in the group. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Considering the problem of the management of IT project portfolios in universities, University managers face a lot of uncertainties when prioritizing projects that make up their portfolio. The alignment with their strategy becomes a major challenge and constitutes one of the essential elements of a governance approach. To overcome this challenge, the implementation of a project prioritization approach adapted to the university's strategy, vision and culture is essential. In this context, this paper aims to provide a multi-criteria approach based on a combination of AHP and TOPSIS methodologies for the selection and prioritization of IT projects in universities. The main feature of our approach is the use of COBIT 5, its principles and enablers as prioritization criteria. In order to validate our model, project portfolio managers of a Moroccan public university were involved to evaluate the criteria and to prioritize their projects. This research demonstrates that the combined use of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies proves to be suitable for the implementation of COBIT sub-process APO05.03. © 2015 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization Limited.},

abstract={Purpose: Triggered by public concerns over office workplace safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study sheds light on the office workplace environment and aims to investigate how organisations respond to forces from the external environment (impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic) and how they modify their office workplace management strategically and operationally to suit the stakeholders’ needs and future development in the post COVID-19 period. Design/methodology/approach: A desktop study was conducted to provide the framework for the in-depth interviews with five corporate real estate (CRE) managers and three workplace consultants. Thematic analysis including coding technique was adopted to analyse the qualitative data. Findings: The findings show that during the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the intended and implemented office workplace modifications are mainly related to two types of risk control: administrative control and personal protection. At a strategic level, organisations react to the external forces by re-modelling their businesses and working towards re-orienting their CRE strategies, such as portfolio transformation, agile portfolio strategies and redesign of the office workplace, etc. Originality/value: This is a topical and timely study that presents the general practice of office workplace modification during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the related CRE management (CREM) strategies developed for the new normal. The findings obtained through in-depth interviews have well supported the CREM strategic alignment theory. It is foreseen that office workplace management will encounter other challenges due to uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study provide a practical lens to look at the future changes of office workplace environment. © 2021, Huiying (Cynthia) Hou, Hilde Remøy, Tuuli Jylhä and Herman Vande Putte.},

abstract={The aim of this paper was to develop methods for addressing the problem of project portfolio selection and present some approaches for evaluating investment portfolio. We proposed two methods for this problem. The first method is based on gray systems and proposed a gray linear programming model. In this regard, first the effective criteria for performance evaluation of project portfolios with literature survey are identified. Then the importance of each is measured with Shannon entropy. For ranking the considered sample, we use gray systems theory. Finally, part investment in each portfolio is determined by the gray linear programming model. The second method is based on the fuzzy ranking method.In this section, 100,000 portfolios are produced by a computer program that each involves 20 different projects the amount of whose investment is between 0 and 100%. Revenue uncertainty of each portfolio is randomly selected. Then use the ranking index that allows decision maker to compare various portfolios and select the best of them. In both methods, we try to use real options theory concepts as a modern and efficient economic evaluation tool for optimal portfolio selection problem. Applicable examples are used to show the convenience and suitability of the proposed methods. © 2014 King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.},

abstract={Purpose: As public organizations strive for higher e-government maturity, information technology (IT) Project Portfolio Management (IT PPM) has become a high priority issue. Assuming control is central in IT PPM, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how a Danish local government conducts control in IT PPM. The authors identify control problems and formulate recommendations to address these. Design/methodology/approach: Adopting principles from Engaged Scholarship, the authors have conducted a case study using a wide variety of data collection methods, including 29 interviews, one workshop, and analyses of documents. Findings: It is found that the local government relies vastly on informal control mechanisms and five control problems are identified: weak accountability processes between the political and administrative level; weak accountability between the director level and the IT executives; IT projects established on the basis of incomplete information about internal resources; lack of operational goals to hold IT projects accountable; and no account of actual IT project costs. The authors propose a model for highlighting how more formal control can be implemented and address the identified control problems. Research limitations/implications: As a single qualitative case study, the results are limited to one organization and subject. Practical implications: The paper has implications for IT PPM in Danish local governments and similar organizations in other countries. The paper shows that the lack of formal control mechanisms makes accountability between hierarchical levels difficult, which deprives organizations of the opportunity to pursue and display unambiguous value from their e-government initiatives. Originality/value: This paper fulfills an identified need to understand how local governments can improve IT PPM. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The innovation ecosystem concept has been widely used as a framework to explain innovation activities within different industries. Despite the usefulness of this approach, the concept is under-theorized, especially with regard to the methodological issues. This article presents a new approach in assessing the effectiveness of innovation industrial ecosystems, allowing to take into account the peculiarities of the life cycle stages of individual innovative projects and an ecosystem as a whole. We illustrate our assumptions on the example of two industrial ecosystems’ projects assessments with appropriate explanations, which help from the academicians, researchers, and readers to receive a comprehensive understanding on how to form a knowledge-intensive ecosystem project portfolio and make managerial decisions on further actions of ecosystem actors regarding project development. The presented methodology has been tested on the example of projects implemented by research centers and laboratories of National University of Science and Technology (MISIS; Moscow, Russia). The propositions arising from this analysis provide information to help academics, policymakers, government, and individual enterprises with a more adequate understanding of the practical mechanisms and tools that help implement the ecosystem model for industrial development. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Technical professionals are a key factor for IT product development. In an IT company, it is common for an employee to hold multiple skills. Multi-skilled staff increases the difficulty of project portfolio scheduling and staff assignment. This paper helps R&D managers cope with the problem by proposing a multi-objective optimization model of project portfolio scheduling and multi-skilled staff assignment. The model considers three objectives with strong practicality, i.e., staff skill enhancement, development cycle time, and product quality, and incorporates skill cultivation through a learning curve. We then propose an improved multi-objective Pareto ant colony optimization algorithm combining genetic operators to find an approximate Pareto solution set. Personalized decision rules with strong practicability are also discussed for selecting an appropriate solution. A case study in a leading electrical device company in China demonstrates the utility of the proposed model and algorithm. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Government funding agencies spend significant amounts of R&D funds through funding programs. While allocating funds among sectors or scientific disciplines, the Decision Maker (DM) wants to maximize the total impact by supporting R&D activities in those sectors with higher scientific, social and economic return. On the other hand, the DM wants to balance the funding budget over sectors or disciplines. In this study, we incorporate the results of “sectoral impact assessments” into the public R&D project portfolio selection (RDPPS) problem. We develop a two-stage model. In the first stage, we make sectoral budget allocation decisions to maximize the total impact of the budget while ensuring a relative balance among sectors. In the second stage, we maximize the total score of supported projects under allocated sectoral budgets. We illustrate the proposed approach on an example problem. We show the value of the proposed approach by comparing our results with alternative policy options. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

funding_text 1={Note that sectors are ranked according to their impact values under each policy option for ease of presentation. We observe that the allocated sectoral budgets might notably change according to the adopted policy option. For example, if the DM selects the score maximization policy, SSH sector will receive a serious amount of funding (i.e. nearly 25 Million TL). However, note that it will get nearly 10 Million TL if the DM applies the proposed sectoral balancing approach. We also observe that HS sector receives no funding under the score maximization policy because the standard knapsack model usually selects projects with lower budgets and higher scores. Note that the cost range of sector HS is the maximum (see Table 2). We also observe that EAEMS sector, the median impact valued sector, receives very little under the score maximization policy. The sectoral budget allocation under the score maximization policy clearly demonstrates that sectoral budget decisions should be incorporated into the decision making process.},

abstract={This paper addresses the capital budgeting problem under uncertainty. In particular, we propose a multistage stochastic programming model aimed at selecting and managing a project portfolio. The dynamic uncertain evolution of each project value is modelled by a scenario tree over the planning horizon. The model allows the decision maker to revise decisions by decommitting from a given project if it shows a negative performance. Risk is explicitly assessed by defining a mean-risk objective function, where the conditional value at risk is used. A customized branch-and-bound method is also introduced for solving the proposed model. Extensive computational experiments have been carried out to validate the model effectiveness, also in comparison with other possible benchmark policies. The numerical results collected by solving randomly generated instances with the proposed branch-and-bound approach seems to be encouraging. © 2012 The authors 2012.

abstract={Due to the limited financial resources of small and Medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the proven approaches for selecting IT project portfolio for large enterprises may fail to perform in SMEs; SME top management want to make sure that the corporate strategy is carried out effectively by IT project portfolio before investing in such projects. In order to provide automated support to the selection of IT projects, it seems inevitable that a multi-objective approach is required in order to balance possible competing and conflicting objectives. Under such an approach, individual projects would be evaluated not just on their own performance but on the basis of their contribution to balance the overall portfolio. In this paper, we extend and explore the concept of IT project selection to improve SME strategy deployment. In particular, we present a model that assesses an individual project in terms of its contribution to the overall strategic objectives of the portfolio. A simulation using the model illustrates how SME can rapidly achieve maximal business goals by deploying the multi-objective algorithm when selecting IT projects. © Copyright 2018 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract={Purpose – The purpose of the paper is to present a theoretical framework and the preliminary results of a research on how to assess information technology (IT) investments so as to deliver maximum business value. Design/methodology/approach – To see whether IT projects fit strategy, the Strategy Map provides a framework for defining the portfolio value and data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used to measure the efficiency of project portfolios. Subsequently, an application that illustrates the value of the framework is described. Findings – The authors offer a framework that integrates the Strategy Map and IT project portfolio management (PPM) and suggest that this conceptual framework will allow an organization to enhance the value of IT investments. Research limitations/implications – This paper is supported by a case study using secondary data only. Practical implications – The suggested method could help CEOs to understand the interactions between projects and strategy and thus supports decision making to prioritize and track IT investments. The paper illustrates how the proposed framework is applied. It also provides the basis for further research. Originality/value – By explicitly linking IT investment with organizational goals, this approach produces results that differ from those of previous studies and provides a strategy-based approach to PPM. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Programs to improve the sustainability of building infrastructures often consist of project portfolios that need to be prioritized in an appropriate chronological fashion to maximize the program’s benefits. This is particularly important when a revolving-fund approach is used to leverage savings from the initial projects to pay for later improvements. The success of the revolving-fund approach is dependent on the appropriate prioritization of projects. Competing performance measures and scarce resources make this task of project prioritization during the planning stage a complex and challenging endeavour. The current study examined the impact of different project prioritization strategies for revolving-fund sustainability program performance. A novel modeling approach for sustainability decision-analysis was developed using the system dynamics method, and the model was calibrated using a campus sustainability improvement program at a major university. The model was applied to evaluate the effects of five common project-prioritization strategies on three program-performance measures, across a wide range of initial investment levels. For the university case study, we found that the strategy of prioritizing projects according to decreasing benefit/cost ratio performed best. The research demonstrated that using a system dynamics model can allow sustainability program managers to make better-informed sequencing decisions, leading to a financially and environmentally successful program implementations. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={Enterprise architecture (EA) and project portfolio management (PPM) are key areas when it comes to connecting enterprise strategy and information technology (IT) projects. Both management disciplines enhance business capabilities, integrate skilled resources, and govern affiliated processes and functions. A skillful comprehension of the links between these managerial areas is essential for effective IT planning. This article elaborates on the common grounds and structural attachment of EA and PPM, showing the substantiated relations between them and demonstrating their cohesiveness. From strategic planning to solution delivery, a conceptual model for IT project alignment integrates these IT management disciplines over two levels. EA ascertains the technical goals and constraints, whereas PPM determines the organizational goals and constraints. The results from both sides are combined to jointly propose, select, prioritize, and schedule IT projects. Roadmapping is a suitable approach to bring EA and PPM together. © 2020 IGI Global.

abstract={Amultiattribute additive value function that has been built from a complete specification of the decision maker's (DM's) preferences gives scale-independent decision recommendations, which do not depend on how the value function is normalized. In this paper, we show that if the preference specification is incomplete, many widely employed decision rules for comparing alternatives give scale-dependent decision recommendations in which the relative ranking of alternatives depends not only on the DM's preferences but also on the normalization of the value function. But because normalization does not involve preference statements, the recommendations should be scale independent so that they do not depend on the chosen normalization. To provide such recommendations, we propose ranking intervals, which show how a given alternative compares with all other alternatives for all value functions that are consistent with the stated preference information. These intervals can be computed from mixed integer linear optimization problems that are constrained by inequalities implied by the DM's preference statements. We illustrate the use of ranking intervals by analyzing university rankings and discuss their uses in project portfolio selection. © 2014 INFORMS.},

abstract={Purpose: This paper aims to propose a model, to operationalize the idea of enterprise risk management (ERM), relying on the concept of capabilities. The proposed model, labelled "Spring model", is specifically tailored to the characteristics of project-based organisations, where risk is to be managed transversally to different organizational levels (enterprise, project portfolio, functions, projects). Design/methodology/approach: A case study methodology is used to exemplify the functioning of the proposed model and display the suitability of the concept of capabilities, as means whereby companies can manage their risk. Data were collected from different sources over a time frame of three years: semi-structured interviews, official documents and presentations, archives, direct observation and internal document usually not available to the public. Findings: The "Spring model" explains how risk can impact different organizational levels (enterprise, project portfolio, functions, projects), and how risk can be effectively managed, at different organizational levels, through the organization's capabilities. Practical implications: The paper gives concrete guidance on the operational elements that project-based organisations should consider for managing risks in a comprehensive and integrated way and discusses potential analysis/insights that could be derived embracing the capability perspective. The empirical testing, performed in a leading oil and gas company, provides an example of its functioning. Originality/value: The paper represents an attempt to apply ERM concepts and tools to operations, making a connection between research in corporate governance and finance, where the ERM concept originated, and research in project management, where attention of researchers tended to concentrate on specific types of risk management practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Today, portfolio management is an important task for all companies. The aim of portfolio selection is to choose a set of projects from a pool of possible projects such that the value of financial actions is maximized conditional on resource availability and technical limitations. However, existing portfolio selection methods and models do not significantly consider the dimension of time. Nevertheless, the best portfolio selection decisions depend on investor characteristics and expectations as well as the coordination of portfolio cash flows with financial plans. In this paper, we provide a goal programming model based on the current perception of the future prices of existing portfolio projects and present a plan for the selection of the optimal project portfolio by taking into account the flows desired by investors. Goal Programming (GP) is a very useful approach in the area of multiple criteria decision making that allows the decision maker to include multiple deviations of restrictions and goals, especially in the area of portfolio selection. This paper gives an application of GP to portfolio selection and analysis problems. To incorporate uncertainty into the model, portfolio prices and multiple criteria are considered in fuzzy conditions. In addition, we consider real option valuation in project portfolio management (PPM). We also present a method of fuzzifying PPM parameters using expert opinions. In applying the model, we consider a 6-project portfolio over five investment periods and compare the use of the model in fuzzy and non-fuzzy situations. © 2014 King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.},

abstract={The discipline of project management has evolved over the years, yet projects still run into trouble, failing entirely, running late, or not delivering expected benefits. Program and portfolio managers need assistance identifying potentially troubled projects while they are being delivered, allowing time to intervene. We report on our investigation of whether project status reports from IT project portfolios can be used to predict projects that may be trending into trouble ahead of time. We found that this initial approach resulted in a high degree of accurate predictions opening new avenues of research in predicting project progress and health. © 2020 Project Management Institute, Inc.},

abstract={Many companies around the world rely on RD to better their chances for profit and permanence in a dynamic market. To keep up with ongoing changes, many ideas arise and some transform into projects. Since resources are limited, organizations seek to select only the most suitable projects to meet their objectives. This is an old practice. However, project portfolio characteristics have changed. The portfolio objectives of today go beyond profit: strategy, environment and society have also become important, along with many other decision criteria. Computational power has also been enhanced, making multi-data decision approaches more feasible, even for small-profit organizations. In the last half century, many authors have proposed multicriteria decision making (MCDM) methods for project portfolio selection (PPS) for Research and Development (RD). Nevertheless, only a few paid due importance to the criteria used, which would be a central issue on any multicriteria decision. Thus, in order to contribute to the RD PPS field of study, this work investigates the hypothesis that the criteria used in RD PPS can be selected in an uncertain environment, according to their influence and importance. To do so, we propose a novel MCDM approach for criteria selection, that integrates Fuzzy-based DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) and Fuzzy-AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) Extend Analysis methods. We are also presenting a case study for a representative electrical-public Brazilian RD organization, that from 2008 to 2018 managed RD project portfolios valued at around US1.2 billion. The results reflect current Brazilian concerns on the prioritized criteria, such as environmental, social and technical criteria, especially on the face of the disaster occurrences that took place on the media on the last years. In an overall manner, the results provide guidance on the topic and facilitate knowledge accumulation and creation concerning the criteria selection process in MCDM-based RD PPS. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to clarify the relevant determinants of IT project decision making and their relevance in corporate practice. Design/methodology/approach: The empiric analysis used in-depth expert interviews (n=18) as method for data collection and qualitative content analysis using evaluative categories for analysis. Findings: Corporate practice is strongly influenced by descriptive decision making. There is only little use of normative decision models in decision making. In corporate practice little use is made of evaluations to analyze achieved project outputs and impacts to improve decision-making practice. This is the result of several evaluation barriers in organizations. Research limitations/implications: The sample is restricted to IT projects as the experts are responsible for IT project portfolio management. Also, an industry comparison is not included in the study. Practical implications: The analysis shows that IT project decision making in corporate practice should include results from descriptive decision theory into project decision processes in corporate practice. More effort should be made in challenging project input data which is relevant for project decision making. By systematically including evaluations for relevant projects, the deviations between planned and achieved project impacts offer valuable feedback for estimators and decision makers. Originality/value: The paper presents detailed analysis on decision variables and their relevance for IT project decision making in corporate practice. Critical aspects of decision making become clear, such as the aspects of evaluation barriers and the need to incorporate descriptive decision-making aspects into corporate decision processes. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Researchers have advocated real options thinking (ROT) for evaluating and managing risky IT investments to account for managerial decision flexibility. Effective ROT is a three-step process that requires managers to recognize, value, and exercise options embedded in IT projects. Prior research has illustrated the existence of managerial bias in the recognizing and valuing real options. However, little research has examined real options exercise decisions. Hence, we use prospect theory to examine whether IT managers demonstrate systematic biases while exercising real options in IT projects and portfolios. We also study whether one can control or mitigate such biases. We found evidence of biased (suboptimal) real option exercise decisions in IT projects and in IT portfolios. However, we found differences in biased decision making between a single project and a portfolio scenario. We also found that project scale and real option type influenced vulnerability of a project to biased decision making. In addition, simplifying the presentation of the net effects of real options exercise decisions can help reduce bias, especially for large project portfolios. We discuss the implications of these results on theory and practice. © 2017, Association for Information Systems. All rights reserved.},

abstract={IS research has predominately studied the alignment of existing IT applications with current strategies. This provides an assessment of the current business value of IT. However, given IT investments are long-term and given that contemporary firms evolve in highly dynamic environments, it is also important to consider the alignment of IT applications that are under development. These applications affect the future business value of IT. This paper rethinks the notion of alignment to include IT applications in development. It conceptualizes the notion of IT project portfolio alignment and develops and tests a model that measures portfolio alignment in a bottom-up process based on individual IT projects. Several formulation methods are proposed and compared.},

abstract={Project selection is a fundamental decision in construction companies. Regarding the high complexity and dynamic nature of construction projects, the level of uncertainty in this industry is very high. Portfolio selection strategy can be considered as one of the best ways for mitigating the risk of project selection. With respect to the considerable importance of project portfolio selection in reducing the risk to a company, developing research in this area is crucial. The main focus of this paper is to present a hybrid model according to the fuzzy case-based reasoning for prescreening of projects according to the factors generating risk in the construction industry and the historical records of the company, also allocating the most appropriate prescreened projects to the portfolio of company with the use of zero-one linear goal programming. A real case study has been presented for model implementation and for more understanding. © Shiraz University.},

abstract={Given the limitation of resources in organizations (time, money, staff, material, etc.), deciding which projects should be given priority – among many competing projects – is a constant and continuous challenge for decision makers. As a result, a proliferation of methods and solutions for project prioritization has been developed, each with its own strengths and limitations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach for prioritizing projects taking into consideration four pervasive challenges in decision making: 1) uncertainty (imprecision and vagueness) of human decisions, 2) reliability (extent of sureness) of decision makers, 3) systematic identification of selection criteria, and 4) robustness of decision making (reasonable tolerance against insignificant changes to decision makers' evaluations during the process). In doing so, we propose integrating Z-numbers theory with Quality Function Development (ZQFD), four Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (Z-MCDM) methods, ensemble ranking aggregation, and sensitivity analysis. The proposed method is then applied in a real-world organization with twenty IT projects to illustrate how our approach might be used in practice. Furthermore, we elaborate on the trustworthiness of the proposed method in light of 16 criteria available in the literature of structured decision making. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Purpose: Project portfolio management (PPM) is a managerial technique used to seek the strategic goals of organizations improving their performance. The public sector has some characteristics that differ from the private sector, since their management approaches are different. The purpose of this paper is to compare the PPM’s practices and techniques in the public and private sectors. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses the study case methodology through eight case studies that were undertaken in Brazil: four in public and four in private sectors. The field research used semi-structured interviews that were analyzed using the NVivo software. Findings: In both sectors, strategic alignment is the goal of PPM, and the same tools are employed. The public sector displays better process documentation and lower risk awareness than the private sector, showing an improvement point for the public sector. The selection and prioritization criteria differ from each sector, showing the difference in the strategic goals of public and private sectors. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this paper are related to the number of organizations studied; however, the case studies represent organizations from different sectors and industries maximizing heterogeneity, but focusing on Brazil. Social implications: The prioritization and effective allocation of projects spending in the Brazilian public sector could be improved with the comparison of their current practices with the ones used in private sector, increasing its transparency and cost allocation. Originality/value: This study broadens the understanding of PPM in the public sector, which is a gap in the academic literature, comparing its practices with those used in the private sector. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The open innovation literature has highlighted that more focus should be placed on non-pecuniary sources such as public research institutes (PRIs) and their performance management (PM), while innovation network studies have highlighted the growing importance of universities and PRIs in public-private research partnerships. Building on PM capability and portfolio management perspectives, this research aims is to examine the relationship between knowledge resources and collaboration outcome in such public-private collaborations, and the mediating role of senior management team's (SMT) ability to govern project portfolio approval and management processes. Examining 153 innovation commercialization collaboration projects between PRIs and firms in Singapore, our study has made several significant contributions to the existing research on innovation and performance in public-private partnership. First, we empirically demonstrate that there is a direct positive relationship between PRIs' knowledge resources and collaboration outcome. Second, our findings establish that the PRIs' SMT ability to govern project portfolio processes mediates this positive relationship. Third, this research highlights that the SMT ability to govern project portfolio processes fully mediates the conversion of market knowledge into innovation. Only partial mediation is observed in the case of technological knowledge, which directly creates value by virtue of generating discoveries or breakthroughs. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Many organisations suffer from a self-inflicted wound - they attempt to do too much! As a result, nothing is done well and profits suffer. Our article addresses this problem by suggesting that managers should focus on a subset of their current initiatives - a subset selected to maximise returns without overstraining resources. We address the following issues: What are the symptoms of work overload? How does an excessive workload adversely impact the bottom line? How can managers determine the throughput capacity of their organisation? What can be done to address the problem of excessive workload? Many, if not most, organisations attempt to operate beyond their capacity, with the result that inefficiencies abound, deadlines are missed and profitability drops. Based on research and consulting experience in many companies, our paper explains the basic concepts of the 25/25 approach to project portfolio management - an approach designed to increase profitability by concentrating only on the work that is essential to the survival and profitability of the organisation. The approach has been successfully applied to dozens of public and private sector organisations companies. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Purpose: Effective and robust governance of major projects and programmes in the public sector is crucial to the accountability of the state and the transparency of state spending. The theoretical discourse on governance, in the context of projects and programmes, is not fully mature, although is now sufficiently well developed to warrant an increased scholarly focus on practice. This paper aims to contribute to the empirical literature through a study of assurance routines in the UK Government Major Projects Portfolio (GMPP). Design/methodology/approach: A framework analysis approach to the evaluation of a subset of GMPP database generates original insights into (1) the framing of assurance review recommendations, (2) the treatment of assurance review data and (3) the subsequent tracking of the implementation of actions arising from the assurance review process. Findings: The analysis reveals that the “delivery confidence” of the major projects and programmes included in this study improves during the time that they are assured on the GMPP. This would suggest that “enhanced” governance routines are desirable in programmes and projects that exhibit high degrees of complexity and scale. Originality/value: The research findings contribute to the wider conversations in this journal and elsewhere on project governance routines and governance-as-practice in the context of government and public services. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Fuzzy multi-period optimization models of supporting decision-making for the selection of project portfolio in the program for an institution’s strategic development are suggested. In the face of uncertainty, it seems promising to use a fuzzy-set approach, in which the verbal expert assessment of the possible impact of the implementation of projects and emerging risks are transformed into fuzzy sets, followed by formulation and solution of fuzzy optimization problems. Corporate social responsibility of the institution is manifested in setting objectives, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders. The risks are taken into account in the framework of Markowitz' portfolio selection theory using a scenario approach. A function of general specific utility is used as a fuzzy objective function, the fuzzy arguments of which are the levels of achievement of the institution’s strategic objectives as a result of the project by the periods given the importance of the objectives and the value of the project discounted costs. It is assumed that the project utility will depend on how the levels of achievement of the strategic objectives grow by periods, while different level growth rates are preferred for different objectives. It is also assumed that different structures of investing resources by periods differ in preference, and therefore additional fuzzy resource constraints are introduced for each time period in the model. Analytical set of the fuzzy objective function is based on a previously proposed universal method for constructing the utility function of an arbitrary number of variables (criteria) at any relationships between variables. A method of setting membership functions of fuzzy general specific utility of projects within the different scenarios is suggested. All constraints in the models are also fuzzy. Fuzzy optimization problems are reduced to the crisp ones and are solved using standard methods. The use of the proposed models is demonstrated by the example of the university. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Trevor Collins is a Research Fellow at the Open University's Knowledge Media Institute, working in the area of technology-enhanced learning. He has over 70 publications in topics spanning software visualisation, visual programming, knowledge representation, semantic web, mobile learning, community informatics and inquiry learning. His project portfolio includes collaborations with industry, museums, charities, schools and universities. He is particularly interested in the synergistic design of technology and learning activities that facilitate and encourage peer dialogue. Trevor has a BEng (Hons) degree in Computer Engineering from Queen Mary College, London, a MSc in Human-Computer Systems from De Montfort University, Leicester, and a PhD in Artificial Intelligence from the Open University, Milton Keynes. Outdoor learning seeks to engage and enthuse students through authentic practical inquiry lessons. This article explores how participatory design and development can enable outdoor learning organisations to introduce sustainable technological innovations within their teaching practices. A case study describing a collaborative project between university researchers and an environmental education charity is presented, which highlights the challenges and issues regarding the usability, scalability and sustainability of mobile technology at a residential outdoor learning centre. It is argued that participatory research with education service providers is a contributing factor to the diffusion of mobile learning and a necessary foundation for sustainable technology-enhanced learning.

abstract={With the increased interest among organizations in managing Information Technology (IT) projects as a portfolio, there has been a growing need for research on factors influencing adoption of IT Project Portfolio Management (ITPPM). ITPPM allows organizations to improve the alignment of IT projects with organizational strategy, by balancing the risks and returns from inter-related projects. To contribute to our understanding of ITPPM, this study examines the adoption of ITPPM through the theoretical lens of diffusion of innovation. Using the technology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework, we model ITPPM adoption and test our model using survey data from 302 project managers. Our results show that an organization's external pressure, ITPPM costs, organizational support, quality of data on existing IT projects, number of IT projects within the organization, and business resistance are significantly related to the adoption decision. We also find interesting results in how expected benefits of ITPPM and compatibility are perceived as equally important by both adopters and nonadopters. In light of the increasingly complex IT project management environment faced by organizations, our paper helps managers to understand and focus on key enablers of ITPPM adoption and better manage ITPPM inhibitors. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={In the project 'Competence-Driven Project Portfolio Analysis' (CDPPA), an integrated system for supporting R&D project selection, staff assignment and activity scheduling with special consideration of the strategic development of competencies has been designed and implemented prototypically. The system has been field-tested at the Electronic Commerce Competence Center (EC3), a public-private partnership R&D enterprise. Experiences from this trial application are summarised and discussed, particularly concerning data collection and competence measurement, the benefits and limits of the chosen multi-criteria decision analysis approach, the evaluation of introduced changes to the decision-making processes, and the transparency of the formal planning model and its components. © 2012 Operational Research Society.

abstract={At university, we are changing from a teaching-centred approach to a learning- centred approach. It is important to have scientific data about the use of such methodologies to evaluate both their usefulness and functionality. The aim of this research was to assess whether applying learning-centred methods would improve students' learning strategies and learning approaches compared to a control group that received teaching-centred training. This was a quasi-experimental cohort design with a non-equivalent control group. The sample consisted of 243 Pedagogy and Social Education students at the University of Valencia (Spain) who studied the same year-1 course. The employed methods sought students' commitment and active participation by using questions, simulations, cooperative work and practical activities, and undertaking a research project, portfolios, etc. The obtained results were positive. The learning strategies of the students who participated in the educational intervention with the leaning-centred approach improved and their deep learning approach increased compared to their peers, who studied the same course by traditional methods. These results prove the validity of these methods and can motivate teachers to choose a learning-centred approach. Moreover, it is relatively easy to apply these methods in classrooms. © 2022 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Technology transfer is the process by which science and technology developed in universities are transferred to companies for technical, scientific, and economic development. Success in this process is affected by several factors; hence it is important to identify them and note how they influence the different dimensions of the success of the technology transfer process. The critical success factors are analysed: adaptation to change, government policies, selection criterion of the project portfolio, work environment, product satisfaction, entropy, stress, and ethics; and, how these affect successes in its three dimensions scientific, social, and financial. A study was carried out based on confirmatory factor analysis and structural equations model on 84 universities in four countries of the Andean region that confirm to 85% confidence that the proposed factors influence all the success dimensions of the technology transfer process. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={As organizations increasingly invest in IT-enabled innovation, practitioners become dependent on IT project portfolio management to mitigate risks generated from multiple projects. However, our knowledge about IT project portfolio governance practices and how interactions between different structural arrangements enable or hinder effective portfolio management is limited. Against that backdrop, we report a case study of IT project portfolio governance in a Danish municipality. Drawing on work design theory (WDT), we identify three types of governance problems—hierarchical decomposition, modularity, and complex network problems—and we uncover the network of observed governance problems in the municipality’s portfolio management practices. As a result, we offer two contributions: a detailed empirical account of IT project portfolio governance, and a demonstration of how WDT can help explain problems in IT project portfolio governance practices. In conclusion, we discuss how these results may inform future research and help organizations improve governance practices in similar contexts. © 2017, © 2017 Lars Kristian Hansen, Pernille Kræmmergaard, and Lars Mathiassen.},

abstract={Interdependencies between projects have come to play a more active role in the decision on IT/IS portfolios and their constituent projects. However, managing these interdependencies can be a complex task, especially when the number and degree of interdependencies among projects are high. In times of uncertainty, unexpected challenges can seriously disrupt projects and, consequently, their interdependencies. This may threaten the project portfolio from achieving its final goal. The study aims to investigate the difficulties associated with managing project interdependence along the development cycle of the project portfolio. The study was conducted using a qualitative approach and semi-structured interviews with managers from four leading organizations in Saudi Arabia. The findings reveal three main categories of factors that increased the difficulty of managing project interdependencies in large IT/IS project portfolios: insufficient understanding of human responsibilities in the whole portfolio, unpredictability of the environment, and technology barriers and constraints. © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={Administrative procedures are intended to increase transparency and help agencies make better decisions. However, these requirements also increase agency workload. Understanding how public agencies satisfy procedural requirements is a critical facet of agency performance. This analysis focuses on the language used in Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) required by the US National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) - specifically, the reuse of similar text within and between assessments. We synthesize theories of institutional isomorphism and bureaucratic coping to understand why text is reused, and consider the tradeoffs of this behavior. Using a national dataset of 1015 EISs published by 22 agencies from 2013 to 2020, we apply local document alignment (LDA) to measure how boilerplate language varies by agency, authors, project type, location, and consulting firm involvement. Latent order logistic and beta regression models applied to the LDA results show that text reuse primarily occurs where there is a clear substantive rationale for boilerplate language or where studies share authors or contract consulting firms. This indicates: (1) that agencies largely do not engage in pro forma compliance efforts; and (2) that while NEPA procedures are oriented around individual projects and decisions, cross-project learning and the narrowness - or breadth - of agencies' project portfolios shape analytical routines and the relative tradeoffs of boilerplate text in policy analysis. This article adds to our theoretical understanding of agencies' coping strategies in response to institutional pressures and makes a methodological contribution by demonstrating the application of text reuse measurement and information extraction methods in public administration research. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.},

abstract={This paper aims to identify financially and environmentally promising project portfolio decisions under CO2 fleet emission restrictions in the automotive industry. These decisions are particularly difficult due to uncertain demand, ever-stricter CO2 fleet emission thresholds, and an increasing number of alternative powertrain technologies that can be integrated into different vehicle projects with high project-specific investments and long product life cycles. We develop a mixed-integer linear programming model that maximizes the net present value of car manufacturers’ project portfolios, so-called cycle plans, by selecting specific vehicle projects and by determining the respective production quantities to comply with the given thresholds for the CO2 fleet emissions. By applying the model to an illustrative European car manufacturer, promising cycle plan decisions are determined and analyzed across six market demand scenarios. The results reveal that compliance with the European emission thresholds until 2035 is generally possible if electric vehicle demand gains momentum, but threshold exceedance and corresponding penalty payments can be financially advantageous in some situations. Long-term compliance with CO2 regulation and financial success is supported by the fast market introduction of battery electric vehicles and the preparation of fuel cell electric vehicles for a later market introduction in large-sized vehicles. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Our analysis addresses innovation processes that shape public policy and the engagement of state and non-state actors in environmental management. Public sector organizations increasingly invest resources in collaborative temporary endeavors–i.e. projects–to explore new ideas and exploit the results. We analyze the environmental project portfolio of the European Commission LIFE program in Estonia for the period 2008-2018 from the viewpoint of interfaces between project teams and permanent organizations. Our analysis of project design, administration, and practices reveals that project interfaces structure opportunities for achieving technical and institutional change through temporary organizations. Adaptive strategies of actors inside projects and in the established organizational fields producse shifts in interfaces across the project life cycle. These shifts enable and constrain knowledge production and application. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Public property owners currently face a great backlog of renovation work at the same time as there is a need to build new, increase cost-efficiency, and comply with new environmental regulations on energy efficiency. To manage these challenges many public property owners have initiated change processes to develop new strategic ways of working with their properties, often aligned with a project portfolio approach. This involves a quite radical shift of practices in these organizations, which requires individuals to engage in institutional work. Recent studies have highlighted how institutional work is shared between humans and objects. To increase understanding of objects’ role in institutional work through which public property owners develop new practices that support a holistic, long-term, and sustainable property management, we analyzed observational data of strategy project meetings in three Swedish public property owner organizations. Findings show how objects have an active role in institutional work through acts of attacking, justifying, and/or safeguarding to maintain, create and/or disrupt institutions. Objects take on multiple roles and both unite and divide human actors as well as evoke emotions that guide actions. Three types of agency are highlighted: relational, discursive, and emotional. Increased knowledge on the role of objects in institutional work and how objects (can) influence human agency assists actors in making better-informed decisions in strategic change processes. © 2021 The Author(s).

abstract={Organizations are currently using the potential of IT to achieve their strategic objectives. IT governance ensures that decisions related to information technologies are aligned with business needs and strategies. One of the best practices to introduce a culture of IT governance is the implementation of the IT project portfolio. However, there is a lack of studies that support this claim. We developed a rubric to evaluate the portfolio of IT projects of a university to determine its strategic nature and its alignment with the principles of IT governance. After a phase of qualitative research, we designed a survey to collect quantitative data in a real scenario. We contrasted these data with the estimated scenario through the results obtained in the previous phase. The objective of this research is to validate and improve the starting proposal as a result of qualitative research. This survey has been answered by Spanish public universities that have implemented a portfolio of IT projects and whose IT managers are aware of the ISO/IEC 38500 standard and its principles. The results have allowed us to design a rubric that can be used by universities to evaluate the relationship between the elements and the advantages of the IT project portfolio and its alignment with IT governance. © 2021 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The purpose of this study is to define a novel hierarchical group decision-making (HGDM) problem. For this problem, a practical solution approach is proposed for information technology (IT) project evaluation and prioritization. HGDM is a decision-making problem with a large number of decision makers (DMs) or experts organized in a hierarchical structure. For this problem, a practical solution approach based on pairwise comparisons is developed. For evaluating the projects in organizations, specifically for the IT projects, a hierarchy of many DMs make project proposals and assess proposed projects using various sets of criteria. The proposed HGDM approach is applied to the evaluation and prioritization of IT projects. A problem with 22 DMs and experts in a three-level hierarchy, 29 criteria and 15 projects is solved using the proposed HGDM approach. The HGDM approach can deal with more complex real-life problems such as problems where more than 500 projects, 100 DMs and experts, and 100 criteria exist. The originality of the study is the introduction of HGDM in the group decision-making environment. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, the partnerships between private companies and public organizations are becoming key elements for improving local development, territorial competitiveness, and delivering innovation. These collaborations are widely promoted by the European Framework Programme for Research and Innovation thanks to the provision of several instruments, such as Horizon 2020. In this context, competitiveness’s improvement of the territory employing research and innovation actions is supported by the technological districts. In Sicily, the AgroBioPesca district has attempted a strategic action named “Call for ideas” in order to design its own roadmap for research and innovation in the agri-food sector. For this purpose, many proponents of public and/or private sectors presented several innovative project ideas referred to specific Technological Trajectories. This paper aims at providing an instrument able to select the most suitable project ideas in order to constitute the AgroBioPesca projects portfolio. To such an aim, the authors propose the application of the multiple criteria sorting method ELECTRE TRI considering criteria deduced by the Horizon 2020 guidelines and documents. The application of this methodology allows subdividing the project ideas received into project ideas to be rejected, reviewable, and eligible for funding. Moreover, to consider the uncertainty of the decision-makers’ judgment, the authors propose a new version of the method in which the crisp judgment is converted into an interval. A sensitivity analysis has lastly been conducted to study the weaknesses of non-financiable projects. © 2019 Editora Mundos Sociais. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Adequately considering project interdependencies has shown to be a determinant of how successful IT/IS project portfolios are managed. However, this can be especially troublesome since there is no universal way to handle many project interdependencies that continue to change over time due to environmental uncertainty or unexpected decisions. This can seriously disrupt portfolio performance. In this article, the authors used the systems perspective to address the problem of managing multiple IT-project interdependencies in complex IT/IS portfolio environment. In particular, the authors propose using the cybernetic model Viable System Model to facilitate thinking and reasoning concerning the difficulty of managing IT-project interdependencies. To validate their approach and to ensure the appropriateness of it, the authors used real-world problem situations drawn from multiple case studies conducted in four leading organizations in Saudi Arabia. The findings support that the Viable System Model can be applied to assist in diagnosing and handling of IT-project interdependencies. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

abstract={The purpose of the paper is to create and apply a method for selecting the maturity level of an organization in the field of project portfolio management. A method for assessing the maturity level of an organization in the field of project portfolio management is proposed. The method is based on assessing the application of principles, functions, life cycle, specialized organizational structure, prescribed roles, and responsibilities for their implementation in managing a portfolio of projects. A distinctive feature of the method is that the evaluation uses a generalized table of project portfolio management processes. The functions performed should be reflected in this table. A method is proposed for choosing the maturity level of an organization’s project portfolio management based on the optimization of the maturity level and costs of project portfolio management.

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present an approach to start industry–university (I-U) collaboration through a stepped process aimed at building a portfolio of research and development (R&D) projects. Design/methodology/approach: It devises from an 18-month action-research program held between a multinational automotive manufacturer and the a top-ranked Brazilian university. Findings: The three-stage R&D shared portfolio methodology results from a combined application of quality function deployment-like correlation matrices and roadmapping. A first matrix tackles industry interests and correlates product performance dimensions and components to reveal broad research areas of interest. A second matrix correlates research areas and engineering competences, highlighting the types of the required know-how from the university standpoint. Thirdly, academic experts help to fill a roadmap-like layer with possible collaborative R&D deliverables over time. Research limitations/implications: Since the study lies on a single experience, extensions to other contexts should be made with care. However, the proposal offers robust rationale and a set of supporting tools to nurture new applications. Practical implications: Theoretical and methodological reflections help managers tackling the long-standing problem of setting a shared R&D agenda. Originality/value: Literature on I-U collaboration tends or to over-emphasize the role of technology transfer offices in promoting the partnerships or to seek implications for public policy.

abstract={An outsourcing IT project management model has been developed. The proposed model features taking into account the specifics of project management processes at outsourcing IT companies in terms of the uncertainty of the external and internal environment of their operation. The model is based on the stage-gate project management framework with fuzzy logic tools. The proposed modification of the fuzzy inference mechanism makes it possible to refuse to save the intermediate results which reduce the load on the database and create the possibility of using semantic networks. The technology of expert consultations was demonstrated by the example of decision-making regarding the assessment of the current status of the IT projects accepted by the outsourcing company for development. Dynamic nature and cyclical management of the portfolio of IT projects involves constant monitoring of the results of implementation with an appropriate regular portfolio reforming. The model was developed to improve the efficiency of the software development sub-process and minimize the negative consequences of financial dependence on the customer. The application software developed on the basis of the model of management of outsourcing IT projects and modification of the fuzzy inference mechanism has found practical application and was implemented in the computational practice of HYS Enterprise B.V. outsourcing IT company. Testing of the program shell has shown positive results in the course of solving the tasks peculiar to concrete stages of IT project management. The proposed structure and composition of the fuzzy knowledgebase of the expert shell are quite typical in terms of IT outsourcing problems. It is expedient to use the developed model at outsourcing IT companies in the process of project portfolio management © 2021. Authors.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to stimulate changes to the way performance data is used to improve performance taking the government’s use of project data as an example. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses systems theory to review the way the government’s major projects portfolio should be analysed. Findings: This paper concludes that broader engagement in the analytics process should be considered as a way of improving insights and learning from reviews. The paper suggests that report alone has limited value. Research limitations/implications: By taking a systems approach, this study raises questions about the methods used to manage data analysis and system improvements. Systems thinking is a useful tool to consider applications such as the performance of the government’s project portfolio, but there are many other approaches that can be applied. Practical implications: This study makes very specific recommendations around the roles and responsibilities of people and teams at different levels in the system. Roles and activities are described together with recommendations about interfering in and overreaching these roles and activities. Originality/value: This paper synthesises a number of systems approaches together with a view of why “we measure” to create a framework for analysing approaches to performance improvement. The practical application provided here gives insights into how these approaches can be used in real-life contexts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Project portfolio management has been studied through diverse aspects. Different approaches have been used to improve project portfolio selection, but not all of them have been actually used. This study presents an artifact to improve project portfolio selection process in universities. The artifact considers strategic alignment and focuses on achieving consensus, considering university characteristics about strategic planning and decision making environment. The artifact was developed through an incremental approach using quasi-experiments in simulated situations to check and improve the accuracy of the solutions being developed. Finally, the artifact was implemented in a real situation inside a university, involving 185 projects, 15 criteria, and 12 people from different faculties and knowledge areas. Results show that the artifact is suitable to the university environment. Beyond the artifact itself and some highlights involving its development process, the multicriteria constructivist approach, the balanced scorecard, and the scoring technique, another contribution is an adapted AHP tool created to integrate traditional AHP from Saaty (1980) and a study from Bose (2015) to reduce cognitive conflict in group decision making. Other studies, in more diverse contexts, still need to be done, but the proposal seems to be promised. © 2020, ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

abstract={Technology transfer (TT) is a tool for the development of societies and its success is affected by several factors; hence, it is important to identify them and note how they influence the different stages of the technology transfer process. The present work identifies new factors (adaptation to change, government policies, selection criterion of the project portfolio, work environment, product satisfaction, entropy, stress, and ethics), the same ones that have been supported in the theories of human and organisational behaviour, these affect all stages of the technology transfer process from university to industry. The study was made based on confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the model of structural equations and was carried out on 85 universities in four countries of the Andean region. The obtained results confirm that, at 95% confidence, the proposed factors influence all stages of the technology transfer process. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Some modified fuzzy multiperiod optimization models are proposed to support decision-making when selecting a project portfolio within an institution's strategic development program allowing for rolling planning of a project portfolio taking into account stakeholder interests and risks. Stakeholder interests are taken into consideration when setting strategic goals. Risk assessment is carried out in accordance with H. Markowitz portfolio theory using a scenario-based approach. A measure of portfolio risk is the fuzzy dispersion of its general specific utility. The developed models differ from the previously proposed fuzzy multiperiod models in possible revision of the composition of the previously selected project portfolio at every step depending on the already achieved results and changes in external and internal conditions. Another important difference is the introduction of additional fuzzy resource constraints for each time period, which are also revised at each step. In addition, constraints on fuzzy discounted costs are introduced and recalculated. Possible division of periods into subperiods is also taken into consideration. Also, at each step, fuzzy project costs are revised per period depending on whether the project is already included in the development program or not. The use of the proposed models is demonstrated based on the example of a university. Further research trends in this area are defined. © 2018 Academic Research Publishing Group.},

abstract={Enterprise Project Portfolio Management systems (EPPM) play a critical role in obtaining organizational success and are far more than just IT projects. Despite their popularity, EPPMs have seemed to fail when trying to work together with performance management systems, e.g. the Balanced Scorecard (BSC). Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an EPPM-BSC model at both the strategic and project level. We tested the model on a case from the pharmaceutical industry and found it to be successful. Contrary to past studies, these results show that BSC, when integrated with EPPM, can be successfully cascaded from the strategic level on to the project level and thus enable managers in developing their own project scorecards. This paper is especially useful to companies who are in pursuit of developing their own performance management systems. Still, further research is needed, especially in finding a suitable model for KPI selection.},

abstract={In order to promote scientific and technological innovation and sustainable development, public funding agencies select and fund a large number of R&D projects every year. To guarantee the performance of the resulting project portfolio and the government’s investment benefits, the decision maker needs to select appropriate projects and determine a reasonable funding amount for each selected project. In the process of project selection, it is necessary to consider the balance of funding allocated to different scientific sectors as well as the failure probability of the projects in future execution, so that the expected performance of the project portfolio is maximized as much as possible. In view of this, we propose and study the uncertain public R&D project portfolio selection problem considering sectoral balancing and project failure. We formulate a stochastic programming model for the problem to support the portfolio decisions of the funding agencies. We also transform the model into an equivalent deterministic second-order cone programming model that can be directly solved by exact solvers. We generate datasets reflecting different scenarios through simulation and perform computational experiments to validate our model. The impacts of various factors (i.e., the number of project proposals, project failure probability, the upper limit of the budget allocated to each project, and the decision maker’s tolerance for project failure) on the project portfolio performance are analyzed. © 2022 by the authors.},

For example, the financial investment of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) has increased from 80 million RMB in 1986 to 28 billion RMB in 2018 []; China’s total R&D investment reached 2786.4 billion RMB in 2021 []. The amount of capital investment received by each approved project has an impact on its performance, which in turn affects the effectiveness of government capital investment []. Since the total amount of funds available to the project funding agencies is limited, when the funding agencies fund R&D projects, they need to select a portfolio of projects with high potential from a large number of project proposals and allocate a reasonable budget for each selected project. As a result, the sustainability and efficiency of public funds are improved, and the project portfolio’s performance is maximized [].},

abstract={This paper presents a simulation of the Project Portfolio Management (PPM) model usage in evaluation and selection of modernization projects of Serbian Railways. Performance review of the selected projects is conducted in regards to the strategic goals of the company, which have been established during the process of strategic planning. The project selection model is methodologically set up as a two-step selection model. The number of portfolio projects is narrowed down by ranking their importance in regards to the success of the modernization program (benefits, risks, and resources), which is followed by the ranking of the projects on the basis of their contribution to the realization of previously chosen liquidity and rentability goals, which are always a challenge when it comes to railway companies. This selection procedure is simulated by applying the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a mathematical model of linear programming, embedded in the software package “Expert Choice”. The simulation results show that, in this way, it is possible to achieve a consider-able drop in the amount of necessary financial resources for the realization of modernization projects, which is also the main contribution of this paper. This proves the efficiency of the PPM concept application as a modern model of strategic management. The showcased model of project portfolio selection can find a significant usage among the current processes of railways restructuring, especially in financing of the projects of public–private partnerships. © 2022 The Author(s).

abstract={Prioritizing information technology (IT) projects for resource direction is a complex decision-making process that involves the analysis of qualitative and subjective criteria. The uncertainty of the subjective and imprecise assessments derived from estimated data that represent the analyzed criteria characterizes the decision-making process. To reduce the uncertainties related to IT project priority setting, we proposed a model based on a hybrid multicriteria method composed by the best–worst method to establish the weights of the criteria and fuzzy-TOPSIS to define the project ranking. The model allows us (1) to define strategic subcriteria, (2) adjust the weights according to the company's reality, (3) to deal with the uncertainties of the evaluations of the decision makers, and (4) provide the project ranking that translates reality into the distribution of resources in the IT sector. Finally, we applied the model to a case study in the IT sector of a Brazilian agroindustrial cooperative. For the managers, the method provides a precise decision aiding tool. Although the model has been applied to the prioritization of IT projects in a cooperative, the same can be generalized to the IT sectors of other companies. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

funding_text 2={Universities obtain financial support from the private sector and increase the experience and work opportunities of students and faculty. In turn, companies gain access to university research infrastructure and knowledge, gain opportunities to hire highly qualified staff and keep abreast of cutting-edge academic research (OECD, 1998). Most of the works that explore direct measures of knowledge interactions, such as R&D cooperation between university-industry, find positive effects on the innovative activities of companies, including the intensity of R&D (innovation input), the propensity to register new patents, as well as the introduction and sale of new products (Lööf and Broström, 2008). Despite the potential benefits of U-I relationships for society, there are several barriers, especially those related to the different sets of norms that rule university research and the private sector (Dasgupta and David, 1994). Therefore, managing U-I interactions beyond individual projects, as well as establishing proper metrics for assessing the running initiatives, is of great importance for the success of a company’s open innovation strategy (Adams et al., 2006).},

abstract={The application of agile methods (AM) in project management has shown great efficiency and remarkable results. However, these methods were born to be applied at team level and not at project portfolio level, where the complexity of managing multiple agile projects and teams leads to several challenges of resource management, priorities and governance model of the project portfolio. The systematic literature review performed in this research aims to identify which practices are the most appropriate to manage the challenges associated with agile portfolio management (APM) and which is the most appropriate context. In this literature review, 28 articles published between 2005 and 2020, related to agile, APM and scaled agile were analysed. The existing scientific literature on APM is still very limited and this research aims to establish the baseline and encourage additional empirical studies in this area. For APM practitioners, it is intended to get an understanding of the most efficient practices and techniques for managing agile project portfolios and how to ensure proper conditions for their implementation.

abstract={A team of competent employees is one of many factors that determine the success of a project. Many approaches have been described in the literature to help decision-makers plan competence frameworks to complete project portfolios. Few of them take into account the disruptions that may occur during the project realization caused, for example, by employee absenteeism, employee fluctuations, etc. In this area, there is still a lack of solutions (methods and implementing them IT environments) that could be used to support decision-makers in planning so-called competence frameworks robust to the disruptions, that guarantee the completion of planned project portfolios. The possibility of the practical application of the proposed method was illustrated in the example of a university. © 2021 Issues in Information Systems. All rights reserved.},

As government investment programs face numerous problems, and these problems impact economic and social development, seven challenges with public investment programs in this article. Developing a new perspective to deal with such issues with the help of project portfolio management (PPM).Next, the challenges of government investment programs in China are clearly evaluated. So presenting the multiple definitions of the project portfolio management so study briefly the history of PPM. Ultimately, with respect to PMI The model for portfolio management, recommending 8 phases to incorporate PPMs in projects investments of government so that the best government-invested portfolio can be efficiently selected, prioritized, managed and tracked, and policy strategic priorities can be related to projects and/or programs. © 2019, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

abstract={Nowadays, it has been acknowledged that there is an insufficiency of projects assessment based on scope, time and cost restrictions to ensure the organization’s creation of value. Despite that, this metric keeps being used and, quite often, it is the only one used to assess the project’s success. This study is based on theoretical references to analyze how some Brazilian and multinational organizations manage the creation of value through their Information Technology (IT) project portfolios. This work aims to understand the processes used and identify the main challenges faced by those organizations. To achieve this goal, an exploratory qualitative approach was used, based on semi-structured interviews with IT portfolio managers from 14 companies of several segments and sizes. The research indicated improvement opportunities and showed that few companies effectively assessed the value generation of their projects, prevailing a perspective of dissonant assessment procedures from corporate results, which does not contribute to the organizational improvement and learning process. © 2019 Brazilian Institute for Information in Science and Technology.

abstract={Research organizations in the spatial sciences face a demanding and changing context, characterized by multiple tensions and significant uncertainty. Increasingly, researchers are also asked to provide policy advice through method-driven processes, rather than ad hoc. In this policy advice context, the paper focuses on a specific tension: strategic planning and developing policy-oriented projects. Until now, little is known about how non-university research organizations deal with this tension as regards providing policy advice in the spatial sciences. Therefore, the paper analyzes the strategy development of the Leibniz Institute of Ecological Urban and Regional Development (IOER) in Dresden. Both authors are affiliated to the IOER. Hence, the paper is written from an “insider perspective” based on scientific concepts such as strategic planning. The paper analyzes project examples that refer to climate change adaptation in cities and regions. It shows that challenges, aims and practices of policy advice are important components of IOER's explicit strategy. The project examples show that projects with the aim of policy advice are implemented in various forms and with significant diversity in terms of strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, the paper argues for the development of project portfolios at the strategic planning level of research organizations in order to consider challenges and aims of policy advice in the spatial sciences.

abstract={Project portfolio selection is an important issue that arises repeatedly over an organization's lifetime. The problem consists of how to plan and allocate a limited set of resources among a set of candidate projects within a given time horizon, while taking into account multiple objectives and constraints that can be different at each period of the planning horizon. This article describes a software tool with a user-friendly environment called the Project Portfolio Selection Tool (PPST), which assists decision makers (DMs) to simultaneously select and schedule efficient project portfolios. This software tool incorporates a general multiobjective model and uses a metaheuristic algorithm as a search engine. By using an interactive procedure, PPST also supports DMs in exploring the solution space to find the most suitable portfolio according to their preferences. We present an application of the software in a state university setting to illustrate the rationale underlying this environment and its usefulness. © 2018 Rect todos los derechos reservados.},
